Hello and Welcome!!

This subrepo speaks about how we can write a programs name from within the program. argc is the count of arguments used on the command line, while argv[] is an array containing all arguments of argc.Hence, argc gives a count of argv.

argc is usually the first item on the command line (./name) designated as argv[0].

Take an example.
################
on the cli, we wanna run a file that has already been compiled. so we type "./filename Theo is good".
here it means ;

1. ./filename is the argc.Which is also = argv[0]
2. Theo = argv[1].
3. is = argv[2].
4. good = argv[3].

Hence, argc = 3.
where argv = [theo, is, good].





Thanks and have a Nice day !
