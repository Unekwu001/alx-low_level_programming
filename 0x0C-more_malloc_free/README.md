HELLO AND WELCOME !!!!

The malloc function is used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program. It will request a block of memory from the heap. If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.

When the amount of memory is not needed anymore, you must return it to the operating system by calling the function free.

ALLOCATION

When you declare variables or when you use strings within double quotes, the program is taking care of all the memory allocation. You do not have to think about it.
