==> In the C++ language, a struct is identical to a C++ class but has a different default visibility: class members are private by default, whereas struct members are public by default. 


==> Besides functions you can also write documentation for structs, unions, enums and typedefs.
Instead of the function name you must write the name of the declaration;
the struct/union/enum/typedef must always precede the name. Nesting of declarations is not supported.
Use the argument mechanism to document members or constants.
