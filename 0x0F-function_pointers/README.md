Following are some interesting facts about function pointers.

 
1) Unlike normal pointers, a function pointer points to code, not data. Typically a function pointer stores the start of executable code.

2) Unlike normal pointers, we do not allocate de-allocate memory using function pointers.

 
3) A function’s name can also be used to get functions’ address. For example, in the below program, we have removed address operator ‘&’ in assignment. We have also changed function call by removing *, the program still works.
