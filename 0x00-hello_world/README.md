0-preprocessor---
Here, we basically standardized the "main.c" by passing it into CFILE (constant variable).
The goal is to use the gcc on "CFILE" instead of "main.c".
Next, we created an executable file (script) called "0-preprocessor", added a compiler statement.
in a nutshell , the 0-preprocessor file was used to compile the main.c file(already embedded into CFILE)
